# File Watchdog
A defensive programming script that allows you to track changes in multiple folders simultaneously.

### The script is written in Python and uses the Watchdog module and the Multiprocessing package:
Multiprocessing is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine. It runs on both Unix and Windows.
